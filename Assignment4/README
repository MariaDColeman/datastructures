I liked this assignment.

For problem 1, I know I could've caught
EmptyException using empty()
inside an if statement, and even though I think
increases the readability of my code, it was
suggested by Peter on Piazza that we shouldnt
use the empty() method, so instead I call top()
inside a try catch block which will check if it
is empty or not.
