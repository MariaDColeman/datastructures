I liked this assignment.

For problem 1, I know I could've caught
EmptyException using empty()
inside an if statement, and even though I think
increases the readability of my code, it was
suggested by Peter on Piazza that we shouldnt
use the empty() method, so instead I call top()
inside a try catch block which will check if it
is empty or not.

For problem 2, I don't have any specific cases to
test for ArrayDeque mainly because we don't have
any other implementations (or haven't been provided
any) so I don't know how ArrayDeque differs from
another implementation. This way (starting out
with no initial value and empty) makes the most
sense for any Deque to follow but if there was
a weird implementation (like how we had SquareCounter
start at 2) then I'd need to make special test cases
for each.

Also, the Professor said that the junit test files do
not have to be checkstyle compliant in class
