I liked this assignment and thought it was a good review.
I decided to use exceptions to deal with FlexibleCounter
instead of the assertions, because that requires that it
is run with -ea. I made an exception called InitializeException
that is thrown if the starting value is < 0 or the delta value
is <= 0.

A hint on piazza says it might be worse for my grade to do this.
I would like to explain the "safer option" in case that was 
desired. I would have:

public FlexibleCounter(int start, int delta) {
    assert start >= 0;
    assert delta > 0;
    this.value = start;
    this.delta = delta;
    this.initial = start;
}
